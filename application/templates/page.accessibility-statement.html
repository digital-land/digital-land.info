      <h1 class="govuk-heading-xl">Accessibility statement</h1>
      <p class="govuk-body">This accessibility statement applies to the Digital Land website: <a href="https://digital-land.info">https://digital-land.info/</a>.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">This website is run by the Digital Land team in the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">We are always working to improve our website and want as many people as possible to be able to access and use it. For example, that means you should be able to:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>change colours, contrast levels and fonts</li>
        <li>zoom in up to 300% without the text spilling off the screen</li>
        <li>navigate most of the website using just a keyboard</li>
        <li>navigate most of the website using speech recognition software</li>
        <li>listen to most of the website using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver)</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="govuk-body">We’ve also made the website text as simple as possible to understand.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        <a href="https://mcmw.abilitynet.org.uk/">AbilityNet</a> has advice on making your device easier to use if you have a disability.</p>
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="how-accessible-this-website-is">How accessible this website is</h2>
      <p class="govuk-body">We know some parts of this website are not fully accessible:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>the maps on our <a href="/map/">National map of planning data</a> and <a href="/entity/56826">entity</a> pages are difficult to navigate using just a keyboard and colours of data layers might be difficult to differentiate for some users</li>
        <li>there’s a limit to how far you can magnify the maps on these pages</li>
        <li>some images published by past suppliers or external teams that we worked with do not have a text alternative</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="govuk-body">We will outsource an accessibility audit on this website in the near future and fix as many of the issues that are found as possible.</p>
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="how-to-request-content-in-an-accessible-format">How to request content in an accessible format</h2>
      <p class="govuk-body">If you need information in a different format, for example large print or accessible PDF, email <a href="mailto:{{ templateVar.email }}">{{ templateVar.email }}</a> and tell us:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>the web address (URL) of the content</li>
        <li>your name and email address</li>
        <li>the format you need</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="govuk-body">We’ll consider your request and get back to you in 21 days.</p>
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="reporting-accessibility-problems-with-this-website">Reporting accessibility problems with this website</h2>
      <p class="govuk-body">If you find any problems that are not listed on this page, or you think we’re not meeting the accessibility requirements, please email <a href="mailto:{{ templateVar.email }}">{{ templateVar.email }}</a> so that we can fix the issue.</p>
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="enforcement-procedure">Enforcement procedure</h2>
      <p class="govuk-body">The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) is responsible for enforcing the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018 (the ‘accessibility regulations’). If you’re not happy with how we respond to your complaint, <a href="https://www.equalityadvisoryservice.com/">contact the Equality Advisory and Support Service (EASS)</a>.</p>
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="technical-information-about-this-websites-accessibility">Technical information about this website’s accessibility</h2>
      <p class="govuk-body">The Digital Land team is committed to making its website accessible, in accordance with the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018.</p>
      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="compliance-status">Compliance status</h3>
      <p class="govuk-body">This website is partially compliant with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1</a> AA standard, due to the non-compliances listed below.</p>
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="non-accessible-content">Non-accessible content</h2>
      <p class="govuk-body">The content listed below is non-accessible for the following reasons.</p>
      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="non-text-content">Non-text content</h3>
      <p class="govuk-body">Some images that were published by past suppliers or external teams that we worked with, do not have a text alternative, so people using a screen reader cannot access the information. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.1.1 (non-text content).</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">When working with suppliers in the future, or allowing other teams to publish on this website, we will make it a requirement that any images meet accessibility standards.</p>
      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="maps">Maps</h3>
      <p class="govuk-body">Our maps are also not screen-reader accessible. To mitigate this we have included a descriptive heading, descriptive text, and a title attribute on the map elements. Also, the maps on the organisations pages display information which is available as text on the page.</p>
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="preparation-of-this-accessibility-statement">Preparation of this accessibility statement</h2>
      <p class="govuk-body">This statement was prepared on 16 September 2020. It was last reviewed on 16 September 2020.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">This website was last tested on 11 September 2020. The test was carried out by the Digital Land team.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">We checked most pages on our site for compliance against the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG v2.0 and 2.1). We plan to get a third-party supplier to run a full accessibility audit of our website soon. </p>
