Your data does not need to be complete or perfect to start. Any data we have from you means we can start to index it and provide it on the platform. Start with what you have and improve it over time.

## Datasets the service supports

Right now, the service supports:

- [article 4 directions](./article-4-direction)
- [brownfield land](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/brownfield-land-registers-data-standard/publish-your-brownfield-land-data)
- [conservation areas](./conservation-area)
- [developer contributions](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/publish-your-developer-contributions-data)
- [listed buildings](./listed-building)
- [tree preservation orders](./tree-preservation-order)

## Datasets we’re developing

We're currently testing and developing data standards for these planning considerations:
