Your data does not need to be complete or perfect to start. Any data we have from you means we can start to index it and provide it on the platform. Start with what you have and improve it over time.

Right now, the service supports:

- [article 4 direction area dataset](./article-4-direction)

- [conservation area dataset](./conservation-area)
