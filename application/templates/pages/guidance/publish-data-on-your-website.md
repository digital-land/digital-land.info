Before you provide your data, you must publish your data on a webpage on your official planning authority website, usually ending in gov.uk. Your local planning authority will always be the source of truth about your data.

Your data must be on a URL the public can access. We collect the latest data from there every day. We call this the ‘endpoint URL’.

You must link to your endpoint URL from your webpage URL.

Endpoints typically fall into 1 of the following 2 categories:

- a file hosted on your web server — these will usually be URLs which end in something like .json or .csv
- a live feed of the data from an API — these are usually hosted by your GIS (Geographic Information System) software or open data platform

Whenever your data changes, update it in the endpoint URL. Your endpoint URL must remain the same, do not change it when you make updates.

Create your webpage
--------------------

The webpage must include, for each dataset:

- the link to the endpoint URL
- a summary of what the data is about
- a statement that the data is provided under the [Open Government Licence](https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3/)
