Your data must be on a URL the public can access. We collect the latest data from there every day.

You must link to that URL from a webpage about the data. This needs to be on your official planning authority website, usually ending in gov.uk.

Why publish on your website
----------------

Your planning authority will always be the source of truth about your data.

Create your webpage
--------------------

The webpage must include, for each dataset:

- the link to the data URL
- a summary of what the data is about
- a statement that the data is provided under the [Open Government Licence](https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3/)


### Example webpage
