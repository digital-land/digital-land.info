We have an online service that checks if some data meets the standard and helps you publish it. 

For now the service supports:

- [article 4 direction area dataset](https://www.planning.data.gov.uk/guidance/specifications/article-4-direction#article-4-direction-area)
- [conservation area dataset](https://www.planning.data.gov.uk/guidance/specifications/conservation-area#conservation-area-dataset)
