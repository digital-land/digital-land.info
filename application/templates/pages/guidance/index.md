Creating a national index of planning data means that developers, housing associations, policy colleagues, researchers and journalists can access the data they need simply and quickly.

It means less overhead for local planning authorities and organisations, reducing the time spent preparing for data requests and freedom of information requests.

Weâ€™re working with a number of local planning authorities (LPAs) and other organisations through the Open Digital Planning community to help them provide data to our Planning Data Platform.
