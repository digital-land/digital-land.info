      Creating a national index of planning data means that developers, housing associations, policy colleagues, researchers and journalists can access the data they need simply and quickly.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      It means less overhead for local planning authorities and organisations, reducing the time spent preparing for data requests and freedom of information requests.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      Weâ€™re working with a number of local planning authorities (LPAs) and other organisations through the Open Digital Planning community to help them submit data to our Planning Data Platform.
