## Local planning authorities (LPAs)

We're working with 12 LPAs to help them provide data through our platform, so they can use the [PlanX](https://opendigitalplanning.org/services) and [BoPS](https://bops.digital) digital planning products.

**Nine of these are currently publishing data.**

### Now

- We're working to onboard 6 more LPAs.

### Next

- We will work to partner with further LPAs.

## Data

We are developing data standards and collecting data that is valuable to housing and planning, and improving the quantity and quality of data on the platform.

### Now

We are working with LPA partners for these areas:

-   [Conservation areas](/dataset/conservation-area)
-   [Listed buildings](/dataset/listed-building) and their [outlines](/dataset/listed-building-outline)
-   [Article 4 directions](/dataset/article-4-direction) and their [areas](/dataset/article-4-direction-area)
-   [Tree preservation orders](/dataset/tree-preservation-order)

### Next

We will continue to develop standards in the following areas:

-   [Design codes](/dataset/design-code)
-   Local plans
-   Planning applications and decisions

## Platform

### Now

- We are improving how we host and operate the platform following moving into beta on a GOV.UK domain.

### Next

- We will soon offer the ability to download data as data packages in excel, geopackage and other formats.
- You will be able to download a dataset and subscribe to changes, to keep your local copy up to date.
- We will improve how we show when and where we collect data from, and how it's been processed.
- We will publish a tool that gives LPAs feedback on the data they provide, in a way they can easily act upon.
- We will explore better ways of searching and finding documents on the site.
