## Local planning authorities (LPAs)

We're working with 12 LPAs to help them provide data through our platform, so they can use the [RIPA](https://www.ripa.digital) and [BoPS](https://bops.digital) digital planning products.

**Nine of these are currently publishing data.**

#### Now

- We're working to onboard 6 more LPAs.

#### Next

- We will work to partner with further LPAs.

## Data

We are developing data standards and collecting data that is valuable to housing and planning.

#### Now

We are working with LPA partners for these areas:

-   Conservation areas
-   Listed buildings
-   Article 4 directions
-   Tree preservation orders

#### Next

We will continue to develop standards in the following areas:

-   Local plans
-   Design codes
-   Planning applications and decisions

## Platform

#### Now

- We are preparing to launch the beta platform on a GOV.UK domain.

#### Next

- We will soon offer the ability to download data as data packages in excel, geopackage and other formats.
- You will be able to download a dataset and subscribe to changes, to keep your local copy up to date.
- We will improve how we show when and where we collect data from, and how it's been processed.
- We will publish a tool that gives LPAs feedback on the data they provide, in a way they can easily act upon.
- We will explore better ways of searching and finding documents on the site.
