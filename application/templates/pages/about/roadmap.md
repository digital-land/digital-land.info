This roadmap shows our current plans for making it easier to find, use and trust planning and housing data.

We work in 3-month cycles and we aim to update this roadmap every 3 months. Our plans can change based on what we learn from speaking to our users, testing iterations, and how we can better deliver on our mission.

Last updated 7 February 2025.

## Local planning authorities (LPAs)

We’re working with 73 LPAs through the [Open Digital Planning community](https://opendigitalplanning.org/community-members) to help them provide data through our platform, so they can use the [PlanX](https://opendigitalplanning.org/services) and [BoPS](https://bops.digital) digital planning products.

We’re encouraging all LPAs in England to provide planning and housing data.

## Data

We are designing and collecting data that is valuable to housing and planning, and improving the quantity of [data on the platform](https://www.planning.data.gov.uk/dataset/).

We regularly ask our community to help us decide the things we need to work on and tell us what they need from the data. See [how you can contribute](https://design.planning.data.gov.uk/how-to-contribute) and [get an existing dataset onto planning.data.gov.uk](https://design.planning.data.gov.uk/how-to-get-existing-datasets-on-to-planning-data-gov-uk).

### Now

We are working with LPA partners to provide data for these areas:

-   [conservation areas](/dataset/conservation-area)
-   [listed buildings](/dataset/listed-building) and their [outlines](/dataset/listed-building-outline)
-   [Article 4 directions](/dataset/article-4-direction) and their [areas](/dataset/article-4-direction-area)
-   [tree preservation orders](/dataset/tree-preservation-order)

We are also working with an [advisory group](https://design.planning.data.gov.uk/advisory-group) to develop a set of open, reusable data specifications to underpin planning applications. We're continuing to add [local plan boundaries, documents and timetables](https://www.planning.data.gov.uk/entity/?dataset=local-plan-boundary&dataset=local-plan-document&dataset=local-plan-timetable&entry_date_day=&entry_date_month=&entry_date_year=) to the platform.

We are making it easier for data consumers and planning policymakers to get involved in our [data design process](https://design.planning.data.gov.uk/data-design-process). We are also taking more data specifications related to local planning through the [Screen and Research stages](https://design.planning.data.gov.uk/planning-consideration/?stage=Screen&stage=Research&stage=%5B%27screen%27%5D) of our process. 

Based on our [data quality framework](https://digital-land.github.io/technical-documentation/data-operations-manual/Explanation/Key-Concepts/Data-quality-needs/#measuring-data-quality), we're introducing checks and changes to data management processes that will ensure the accuracy, consistency, and integrity of all datasets. 

### Next

We'll be adding more datasets needed by the Planning Inspectorate and nationally significant infrastructure projects (consultees and geographies). We will draft a template Statutory Instrument for potential data standards.

## Platform

### Now

We are making it possible to rebuild our data quickly and reliably, in hours not days. We are also increasing the number of [title boundaries](https://www.planning.data.gov.uk/dataset/title-boundary) available on the platform after scaling our infrastructure. We're also making [our service for data providers](https://submit.planning.data.gov.uk) more responsive and reducing the time it takes to deploy changes to infrastructure.

We are improving the guidance in [our service for data providers](https://submit.planning.data.gov.uk) and introducing email notifications, which will make it easier for local planning authorities to understand, address and improve the quality of the data they’ve provided. We're also bringing the data quality checks into the service, meaning local planning authorities can prepare and provide smaller datasets sooner, increasing the amount of authoritative data available on the platform.

We are partnering with the Incubator for AI, exploring how to use generative artificial intelligence to extract data from planning documents.

We are running a discovery to understand the value of the platform for policymakers, analysts, and property companies, and to provide more valuable features for PropTech companies, supporting a growing market of planning products and services using open data we make available. 

### Next

- We will make it possible for local planning authorities to provide planning applications and decisions through our service
- We will add new features that make it easier for people to consume the data, based on the findings from our discovery
- We will explain the principles that guide us in making planning and housing data easy to find at a national scale
- We will further explain our quality-checking processes and the development stages for certain datasets, making what we do transparent so that the data is easier to trust

### Later

- We will explore alternative options for warehousing reporting data to make it cheaper to run the platform
- We will make users more aware of how their data is benefitting other people and organisations
