This roadmap shows our current plans for making it easier to find, use and trust planning and housing data.

We work in 3-month cycles and we aim to update this roadmap every 3 months. Our plans can change based on what we learn from speaking to our users, testing iterations, and how we can better deliver on our mission.

Last updated 7 February 2026.

## Designing Data

We are designing and collecting data that is valuable to housing and planning, and improving the quantity of [data on the platform](https://www.planning.data.gov.uk/dataset/).

We regularly ask our community to help us decide the things we need to work on and tell us what they need from the data. See [how you can contribute](https://design.planning.data.gov.uk/how-to-contribute) and [get an existing dataset onto planning.data.gov.uk](https://design.planning.data.gov.uk/how-to-get-existing-datasets-on-to-planning-data-gov-uk).

### Now

We are also working with an [advisory group](https://design.planning.data.gov.uk/advisory-group) to develop a set of open, reusable data specifications to underpin planning applications. We're continuing to add [local plan boundaries, documents and timetables](https://www.planning.data.gov.uk/entity/?dataset=local-plan-boundary&dataset=local-plan-document&dataset=local-plan-timetable&entry_date_day=&entry_date_month=&entry_date_year=) to the platform.

We are making it easier for data consumers and planning policymakers to get involved in our [data design process](https://design.planning.data.gov.uk/data-design-process). We are also taking more data specifications related to local planning through the [Screen and Research stages](https://design.planning.data.gov.uk/planning-consideration/?stage=Screen&stage=Research&stage=%5B%27screen%27%5D) of our process.

Based on our [data quality framework](https://digital-land.github.io/technical-documentation/data-operations-manual/Explanation/Key-Concepts/Data-quality-needs/#measuring-data-quality), we're introducing checks and changes to data management processes that will ensure the accuracy, consistency, and integrity of all datasets.

### Next

- We'll be adding more datasets needed by the Planning Inspectorate and nationally significant infrastructure projects (consultees and geographies). We will draft a template Statutory Instrument for potential data standards.
- We will make it possible for local planning authorities to provide planning applications and decisions through our service

### Later

## Collecting & Managing Data

### Now

We are making it faster and more reliable to build and rebuild planning data. Our platform can now be refreshed in hours rather than days, giving users quicker access to up-to-date, authoritative information. This work has also allowed us to scale our infrastructure, increasing the number of [title boundaries](https://www.planning.data.gov.uk/dataset/title-boundary) available on the platform.

We’re working with local planning authorities (LPAs) across England to help them provide planning and housing data through our platform. Through the [Open Digital Planning community](https://opendigitalplanning.org/community-members), we’re supporting 209 LPAs to publish data and adopt digital planning products such as [PlanX](https://opendigitalplanning.org/services) and [BoPS](https://bops.digital).

We are working with LPAs to provide data for these areas:

- [Article 4 directions](/dataset/article-4-direction) and their [areas](/dataset/article-4-direction-area)  
- [Conservation areas](/dataset/conservation-area) and their [documents](/dataset/conservation-area-document)  
- [Listed buildings](/dataset/listed-building) and their [outlines](/dataset/listed-building-outline)  
- [Tree preservation orders](/dataset/tree-preservation-order), alongside the [trees](/dataset/tree) and [zones](/dataset/tree-preservation-zone) they cover  

To support this work, we are improving [our service for data providers](https://provide.planning.data.gov.uk). The service is now more responsive, with faster loading times, clearer guidance and new features such as showing non-authoritative data from alternative public sources. All of these help LPAs understand, improve and maintain the quality of the data they’ve provided.

We’re also bringing data quality checks directly into the service. This allows LPAs to validate data earlier, submit smaller datasets more easily, and publish high-quality data sooner - increasing the amount of trusted, authoritative data available on the platform.

Our ambition is for all local planning authorities in England to provide planning and housing data through the platform, helping to create a more open, consistent and reliable planning system.

### Next

- We will increase the number of datasets available through the Provide service including developer contributions and local plans
- We will create an internal tool to speed up and simplify getting new data onto the platform
- We will continue to scale our platform's ability to transform large datasets, including index polygons and UPRNs.
- We will revisit how we playback data quality checks to LPAs, focusing on which tasks will have the greatest impact on their quality score

### Later

- We will explore alternative options for warehousing reporting data to make it cheaper to run the platform
- We will implement more complex data quality checks so that the data is easier to trust

## Consuming Data

### Now

We are running a discovery to understand the value of the platform for policymakers, analysts, and property companies, and to provide more valuable features for PropTech companies, supporting a growing market of planning products and services using open data we make available.

### Next

- We will add new features that make it easier for people to consume the data, based on the findings from our discovery
- We will explain the principles that guide us in making planning and housing data easy to find at a national scale

### Later

- We will make users more aware of how their data is benefitting other people and organisations
