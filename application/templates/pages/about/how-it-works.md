Planning and housing data is published by multiple organisations across England. Planning is devolved to local planning authorities (LPAs) across the country, which means that the data is published on over 300 local authority websites and data portals. Each LPA has its own uses for the data, and it can be hard to aggregate similar datasets from multiple LPAs.

When an LPA publishes open data and shares the data source, our platform collects the data and transforms it into a consistent state, across England. Data standards provide instructions for how to organise the data, which makes it possible to collect the data from a wide range of sources and make it consistent. The platform also provides [guidance](/guidance/) and [tools](https://check.planning.data.gov.uk) to minimise the work LPAs have to do to contribute their data.

The platform also indexes data related to planning and housing from other organisations, such as public transport access nodes from Department for Transport and national nature reserves from Natural England.

This means you can stick a pin in a map and see a range of datasets from many organisations
