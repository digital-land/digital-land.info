## Availability

We index planning and housing datasets provided by multiple organisations in England.

Many datasets have one owner providing the data nationally. There are 8 datasets compiled from data sources provided by local planning authorities (LPAs) across England.

You can [help identify and design data](https://design.planning.data.gov.uk/how-to-contribute) that would be useful on the platform.

## Quality

We check data sources for issues and help data owners improve the quality. This increases the quality and trustworthiness of the data at national scale. For example, we check for invalid dates, geometries that fall outside of administrative boundaries, and identify duplicate entities that need reconciling.

We are revising our data quality metrics and will publish the performance soon.

## Coverage

We aim to provide datasets from authoritative sources covering the entirety of England. Weâ€™re currently working with 73 out of 311 local planning authorities to start providing 8 datasets nationally.

We are revising our data coverage metrics and will publish the performance soon.
