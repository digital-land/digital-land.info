Performance indicators show how the planning data platform is making it easier to find, use and trust planning and housing data in England.

Last updated 28 August 2024.

## Availability

We index planning and housing datasets provided by multiple organisations in England.

Many datasets have one owner providing the data nationally. There are 8 datasets compiled from data sources provided by local planning authorities (LPAs) across England.

### 93 datasets on the platform

93 datasets available from 377 organisations. <!--? added last month (+/-0%). -->

138 data sources out of 584 provided by 33 local planning authorities. 7 up from last month (+1.2%).

2 new local planning authorities providing data this month (+2.7%).

You can [help identify and design data](https://www.planning.data.gov.uk/) that would be useful on the platform.

## Quality

We check data sources for issues and help data owners improve the quality. This increases the quality and trustworthiness of the data at national scale. For example, we check for invalid dates, geometries that fall outside of administrative boundaries, and identify duplicate entities that need reconciling.
