Planning Data aims to make land and housing data easier to find, understand, use and trust.

We believe this will lead to:

-   better planning decisions
-   fewer uncertainties and delays in the housing system
-   more new digital services for property and planning
-   better relationships between communities and developments

Our platform collects planning and housing data from local planning authorities (LPAs) and transforms it into a consistent state, across England. Anyone can view, download and analyse the data we hold. We are currently working with a set of LPAs to collect data according to our draft standards, that will be collected by the platform.

To find out how our platform is developing, please see our [roadmap](roadmap.html).

LPAs
----------------

We work with LPAs that received funding to improve their planning services through the [Local Digital Fund](https://www.localdigital.gov.uk/fund/). We are currently working with:

-   Bolsover District Council and North East Derbyshire District Council (joint project team)
-   Buckinghamshire
-   London Borough of Camden
-   Dacorum Borough Council
-   Doncaster Metropolitan Borough Council
-   Gloucester City Council
-   Lambeth
-   Medway Council
-   Newcastle City Council
-   Southwark

Data collections
----------------

You can view the data we currently have as [text](/dataset/) or on a [map](/map/).

LPAs store data in different ways. We're working with our partners on how to collect the data in a way that the platform understands, with minimum work and technical expertise for LPAs. This means ongoing work on the platform and data collection pipeline, as well as creating data standards.

### Data standards

Data standards are instructions for how to organise data, in order to share it effectively. They make it possible for platforms like Planning Data to collect data from a wide range of sources, and automatically produce correct and consistent outputs.

For example, we need all LPAs to enter dates in the same way, so our platform knows that 1-2-2020 always means the 1st of February - not the 2nd of January.

We want to minimise the work LPAs will need to do to contribute their data. We have created guidance on how to meet the standards, and will continue to revise this through user testing.

How the data will be used
-------------------------

The data is available for anyone to download, analyse, interpret, and use to develop tools and services, under the terms of the open licence and attribution for each dataset.

There are 2 services already in development:

-   [Back Office Planning System (BoPS)](https://bops.digital)
-   [Reduce Invalid Planning Applications (RIPA)](https://www.ripa.digital/understanding-the-problem)

Services like RIPA and BOPS have the potential to save LPAs millions each year, as well as improving the planning process for homeowners and developers.
